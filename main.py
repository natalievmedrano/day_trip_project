#Store the trip options for destinations, restaurants, transportation, and entertainment each in their own List (this would be good to place at the top of the file)
#Get a random element from each of those sets of options. We recommend declaring variables for a random destination, restaurant, transportation, and entertainment
#Display the initial random trip to your user
#Prompt the user to see if they are satisfied
#If not, find out which trip feature they want to change and randomly select a new feature.
#Keep doing this process until the user is satisfied with the trip
